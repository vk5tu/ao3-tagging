Here's the details from the font itself:

Description:

> PT Sans is a type family of universal use. It consists of 8 styles:
> regular and bold weights with corresponding italics form a standard
> computer font family; two narrow styles (regular and bold) are
> intended for documents that require tight set; two caption styles
> (regular and bold) are for texts of small point sizes. The design
> combines traditional conservative appearance with modern trends of
> humanistic sans serif and characterized by enhanced
> legibility. These features beside conventional use in business
> applications and printed stuff made the fonts quite useable for
> direction and guide signs, schemes, screens of information kiosks
> and other objects of urban visual communications.
>
> The fonts next to standard Latin and Cyrillic character sets contain
> signs of title languages of the national republics of Russian
> Federation and support the most of the languages of neighboring
> countries. The fonts were developed and released by ParaType in 2009
> with financial support from Federal Agency of Print and Mass
> Communications of Russian Federation. Design - Alexandra Korolkova
> with assistance of Olga Umpeleva and supervision of Vladimir
> Yefimov.
